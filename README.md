# Stephanie's fMRI Analysis Repository - R and Python

The contents are standalone scripts for fMRI analysis and a few other general tasks in R and Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

R or Python. Hasn't been tested across versions.

### Overview

Some of these materials have been developed to conduct the core analyses for a project and are described below.


#### 1. Meta-analysis of test-retest reliability in functional connectivity

*Location:* *R > myscripts > TRT\_review*

*Purpose:* Perform meta-analysis of ICC studies 

*Usage:* Data for this study is given in Table 1 of the manuscript. Use this instead of path given in  *trt\_meta*.

(Reference forthcoming) 


#### 2. Multisite test-retest reliability in functional connectivity - visualization

*Location:* *R > myscripts > TRT\_multisite*

*Purpose:* Visualize ICC distributions. A kludge-y solution to making asymmetric violin plots. Main code is *main.R*.
See *fmri\_scripts\_matlab* repository for calculating Generalizability Theory ICCs.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the materials provided here! Although I try to make all my code publicly available, some of the materials in this repository have been developed for more private use and may therefore require further explanation.
